# Responsive Layout Final Project

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/YOUR-BADGE-ID/deploy-status)](https://main--nmresponsivefinal.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview

This project is the final submission for a responsive layout course. The primary objective was to create a fully responsive website that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices. Instead of using just regular HTML and CSS, I decided to build the project using **React** and **Vite** to enhance the learning experience and demonstrate the use of modern JavaScript frameworks in responsive design.

## Wireframe and Design Specifications

The project was based on a wireframe provided as part of the course. The design required specific breakpoints to ensure the layout adjusts properly across devices.

- **Netlify**: For deployment, providing a fast and reliable hosting service.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The site is fully responsive, adjusting perfectly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **State Management**: The navigation bar utilizes React state to toggle the menu on smaller screens, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- **Modern Development Workflow**: The project was developed using React and Vite, which allowed for a fast and efficient development process.
